              configuring and extending analysis. It is open source, free to
              use, and supports full reproducibility of results. The Ensembl

               high-throughput sequencing data",
  author    = "Wang, Kai and Li, Mingyao and Hakonarson, Hakon",
  abstract  = "High-throughput sequencing platforms are generating massive
               amounts of genetic variation data for diverse genomes, but it
               remains a challenge to pinpoint a small subset of functionally
               important variants. To fill these unmet needs, we developed the
               ANNOVAR tool to annotate single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and
               insertions/deletions, such as examining their functional
               consequence on genes, inferring cytogenetic bands, reporting
               functional importance scores, finding variants in conserved
               regions, or identifying variants reported in the 1000 Genomes
               Project and dbSNP. ANNOVAR can utilize annotation databases from
               the UCSC Genome Browser or any annotation data set conforming to
               Generic Feature Format version 3 (GFF3). We also illustrate a
               'variants reduction' protocol on 4.7 million SNVs and indels
               from a human genome, including two causal mutations for Miller
               syndrome, a rare recessive disease. Through a stepwise
               procedure, we excluded variants that are unlikely to be causal,
               and identified 20 candidate genes including the causal gene.
               Using a desktop computer, ANNOVAR requires ∼4 min to perform
               gene-based annotation and ∼15 min to perform variants reduction
               on 4.7 million variants, making it practical to handle hundreds
               of human genomes in a day. ANNOVAR is freely available at

              and filtering of {SNPs} and indels",
  author   = "Pedersen, Brent S and de Ridder, Jeroen",
  abstract = "Germline and somatic variants within an individual or cohort are
              interpreted with information from large cohorts. Annotation with
              this information becomes a computational bottleneck as population
              sets grow to terabytes of data. Here, we introduce echtvar, which
              efficiently encodes population variants and annotation fields
              into a compressed archive that can be used for rapid variant
              annotation and filtering. Most variants, represented by
              chromosome, position and alleles are encoded into 32-bits-half
              the size of previous encoding schemes and at least 4 times
              smaller than a naive encoding. The annotations, stored separately
              within the same archive, are also encoded and compressed. We show
              that echtvar is faster and uses less space than existing tools
              and that it can effectively reduce the number of candidate
              variants. We give examples on germ-line and somatic variants to
              document how echtvar can facilitate exploratory data analysis on
              genetic variants. Echtvar is available at
              https://github.com/brentp/echtvar under an MIT license.",
